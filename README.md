 # Abstract
 Membrane lipids such as glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are increasingly recognized as vital proxies for paleoenvironmental and climatic reconstructions. This field is rapidly evolving, with frequent publications introducing new calibrations, indices, and ratios derived from a diverse range of compounds. Despite the availability of software for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data extraction, there is a notable lack of automated workflows for subsequent data processing. In response, we introduce “GaDGeT”, a comprehensive R-based software solution designed to calculate concentrations, fractional abundances, and published GDGT-indices and ratios. Users input HPLC-derived peak area datasets, and GaDGeT automatically processes these data, organizing the results into a structured directory system. GaDGeT’s advantages lie in its implementation in R, known for its data manipulation, analysis, and visualization capabilities, and its open-source nature, ensuring reproducibility and transparency. The platform-independent design of GaDGeT makes it accessible and adaptable for researchers of varying expertise levels in GDGT research. Additionally, users can easily add new calculations, allowing the software to evolve with advancements in the field. This software aims to streamline GDGT data analysis, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of paleoenvironmental and climatic studies.
